## Plotly

In this project I will use the Ameshousing library, I will make a plot to know how is the influence of the price depending on the lot area of the property and I will add the neighborhood to each data point.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(AmesHousing)
h <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
plt <- h %>%
  plot_ly(x=~Lot_Area, y=~Sale_Price, size =~ Gr_Liv_Area, color =~ Neighborhood, text =~ Neighborhood, hoverinfo = "text", type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers')
plt <- plt %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(type="log"))
plt
```
